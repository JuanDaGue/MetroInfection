# Metro Zombies

Metro Zombies is a tower-defense style survival game set in a post-apocalyptic, nocturnal Medellín. Players ride a moving metro car between stations, fighting off hordes of zombies, repairing the train, setting traps, and defending critical points. Each segment between stations is a mission with its own time limit, hazards, and dynamic events.
